##### Development specs:

Spec #1: Get input from user, store in variable as array of words
Spec #2: Separate input into two categories: (Starts with Vowel) or (Starts with Consonant(s))
         vowel -> true || consonant -> false
         input: "hello" output: false
Spec #3: Check if first letter is y (so we can treat it as a consanant)
         input: "yellow" output: false
Spec #4: Add function/condition: If starts with vowel, append "way"
         input: "ice" output: "iceway"
(steps 5+6: find all leading consonants)
Spec #5: Find first vowel's index
         input: "Theater" Output: 2
Spec #6: Capture all letters in front of spec 5's result
         input: "Theater" output: "th"
Spec #7: Check if last captured letter is q
         input: "square" Output: true
Spec #8: Check if vowel u comes after q
         input: "square" output: true
Spec #9: Include "u" in characters to be moved
         input: "square" output: squ
Spec #10: Move the characters to the end
         input: "square" output: aresqu
Spec #11: Add "ay" to the end
         input: "aresqu" output: aresquay
